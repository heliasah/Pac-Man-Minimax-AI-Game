# Overview
This project is a Python implementation of a simple Pac-Man game with an AI-controlled Pac-Man and two ghost enemies. The game demonstrates the use of the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to make decisions for Pac-Man's movements in a maze-like environment. The game board is generated using a predefined grid layout, and the ghosts move randomly. The objective for Pac-Man is to collect as many dots (+) as possible while avoiding the ghosts.

# Features

- AI-Controlled Pac-Man: Pac-Man uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to decide the best move at each turn.
- Random Ghost Movements: The two ghost characters move randomly within the game board.
- Scoring System: Pac-Man gains points for collecting dots and loses the game if caught by a ghost.
- Game Board Representation: The board is represented as a 2D grid where walls (#), dots (+), Pac-Man (p), and ghosts (G and g) are displayed.
